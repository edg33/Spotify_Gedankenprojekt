# Understanding the Impact of Spatial Audio on User Behavior: A Thought Experiment

This project would explore how **spatial audio** affects music streaming behavior by analyzing **engagement metrics** such as listening time, skip rates, and user preferences. The study proposes a **data-driven approach** using big data techniques to uncover insights into the adoption and impact of spatial audio within Spotify's user base.  

## Overview  

While research on **spatial audio** has traditionally focused on **technological advancements and user experience**, there is limited exploration of **how users engage with spatial audio in real-world settings**. This study aims to bridge that gap by analyzing **listening session data** from Spotify to determine the effect of spatial audio on user behavior.  

### Key Research Questions  
- Does **spatial audio usage** correlate with increased listening time and lower skip rates?  
- Are **specific user segments** more likely to engage with spatial audio?  
- How does **genre preference** influence spatial audio adoption?  
- What **business implications** does spatial audio have for streaming services and hardware manufacturers?  

## Data Requirements  

Given the **large-scale** nature of this project, **big data infrastructure** is essential for handling high-volume streaming data.  

### **Primary Data Sources**  
- **Spotify Listening Session Data** ([Brost et al., 2019](https://doi.org/10.1145/3308558.3313641))  
  - Engagement metrics: **session length, number of skips, track start reasons**  
  - Track metadata: **popularity, tempo, danceability, valence, and energy**  
  - Device information: **whether a track was played using spatial audio**  
- **Apple Spatial Audio API Data** ([Apple Developer Documentation](https://docs.developer.apple.com/documentation/analytics-reports/spatial-audio-usage))  
  - Device-specific data on **spatial audio usage** (limited to Apple users)  

## Technology Stack  

The study will utilize **cloud-based big data solutions** to efficiently **store, process, and analyze** listening session data.  

### **Storage & Data Processing**  
- **Snowflake** (Data Warehousing)  
  - **Multi-cluster** architecture for handling complex queries  
  - Supports **structured and semi-structured** data (e.g., JSON from Apple API)  
  - Uses **Snowpipe** for real-time data ingestion  
- **Apache Spark (via Databricks)**  
  - Distributed computing for **scalable processing**  
  - Enables **machine learning workflows** for predictive modeling  
  - Supports **real-time streaming analysis**  

### **Machine Learning & Statistical Methods**  
- **Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)**: Understand **user behavior trends**  
- **K-Means Clustering**: Segment users based on **listening habits and spatial audio preferences**  
- **Random Forest Classifier**: Predict whether a user is likely to engage with spatial audio  
- **T-Tests & ANOVA**: Compare engagement levels between **spatial audio and non-spatial audio users**  

### **Visualization & Reporting**  
- **Tableau**: Create **interactive dashboards** for business stakeholders  
- **SQL Queries (Snowflake)**: Generate **custom reports** on spatial audio trends  

## Expected Outcomes  

- **Spatial audio usage trends**: Identify which users engage with spatial audio and **how it affects listening behavior**.  
- **Segmented audience insights**: Determine **which genres and demographics** benefit most from spatial audio.  
- **Business implications**: Provide **actionable recommendations** for **streaming services, artists, and hardware manufacturers**.  

## Potential Impact  

- **For Spotify & Streaming Services**  
  - Optimize **content recommendations** for spatial audio users.  
  - Develop **spatial audio-exclusive features** to enhance user engagement.  
- **For Consumer Electronics Companies**  
  - Validate **spatial audio investments** by demonstrating real-world user adoption.  
  - Guide **product development** for spatial audio-enabled devices.  
- **For Artists & Music Producers**  
  - Inform decisions on whether to **produce music in spatial audio formats**.  
  - Identify **which genres benefit most** from spatial audio technology.
